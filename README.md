# Overview

XYNAE is a revolutionary decentralized platform built on BNB Chain that enables users to launch AI agent tokens with automated market making through bonding curve mechanics. The platform combines the power of blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, allowing creators to tokenize their AI agents and enable autonomous value creation through the x402 protocol. Every agent launched on XYNAE becomes a tradable BEP-20 token with built-in liquidity, price discovery, and automatic graduation to PancakeSwap when market cap thresholds are reached.

The platform operates on a simple yet powerful premise: AI agents should be able to generate and capture economic value autonomously. By tokenizing agents, XYNAE creates a new paradigm where intelligent systems can participate in decentralized finance, earn through on-chain activity, and provide transparent monetization mechanisms for their creators and holders. The bonding curve mechanism ensures fair price discovery from the moment of launch, eliminating the need for initial liquidity provision while preventing front-running and manipulation that plague traditional token launches.

XYNAE's architecture is built on three core pillars: the AgentLaunchpad smart contract that handles token creation and bonding curve logic, a Next.js frontend application that provides an intuitive user interface for launching and trading tokens, and an IPFS-based metadata storage system that preserves agent characteristics and images in a decentralized manner. This documentation provides comprehensive coverage of all system components, from low-level smart contract functions to high-level user interactions.

#### Long-Term Vision

XYNAE envisions a future where:

* **AI agents are first-class economic entities** with the ability to own, earn, and transact value autonomously
* **Anyone can create and monetize AI agents** without needing deep technical knowledge or significant capital
* **Communities own and govern the AI agents** they use and value through transparent token mechanisms
* **Fair launches are the standard** with bonding curves eliminating manipulation and ensuring equal access
* **AI and DeFi are deeply integrated** with agents participating seamlessly in decentralized financial systems
* **Value flows transparently** from AI activities to token holders through automated, auditable mechanisms
* **Cross-chain agent networks** operate across multiple blockchains with unified identity and value capture
* **Decentralized governance** allows token holders to guide agent behavior and development priorities
